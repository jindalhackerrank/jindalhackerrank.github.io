                <p>This is built using calculating the image positions using the fixed-partition algorithm.This would 
                    help in maintaining the aspect ratio the image.
                    <div>
                        <h2>Optimizations Done in this approach</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The number of dom elements are same throughout the infinite scroll.Padding is adding at the top
                                on infinite scroll and dom elements are changed with new images and on reverse scroll they are replaced with
                                previous urls.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Made use of intersection observer to observe the first and last element and do further processing on the basis of that.
                                Intersection Observer is much performant that scroll event.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Made use of actual image aspect ratio . Each list element consist of 5 images and their position is
                                calculated using fixed-partition algorithm that helps maintaining their aspect ratio.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h2>Things that can be improved with better api</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the api returns height and width of image before hand . We could show the block loader for the images and lazy load 
                                the image when the block comes to view port.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the api sends a list of image that would be more optimal.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
